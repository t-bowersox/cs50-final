# cs50-final
A todo list app created as my final project for Harvard's CS50x.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the repository in your editor.
    - Recommend using VS Code with the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed.
3. If using a Dev Container, the database migration script will be run for you. Otherwise, make sure you have python3 installed and run the migration script manually from the workspace root:

```bash
python db/migrate.py
```

4. If you are not using a Dev Container, you will also need to run the following to install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
